## _Ice-Cream & Cocktail Bar Map Project_


### About


This a Neighborhood Map project in *[Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)*.
The project aimed at building a single-page application featuring an area on Google Maps.
For this project I decided to list down ice-cream shops and cocktail bars in Italy and Croatia. The website lists the locations of my interest and can be filtered out through search bar.


### **The website can be reached at *[Ice-Cream & Cocktail Bar Website](https://snehal1791.github.io/Neighborhood-Map/)*.**


The application also made use of Knockout.JS.

Gruntfile is being used to generate minified javascript and css files.
