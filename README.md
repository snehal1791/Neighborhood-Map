### About


This a Neighborhood Map project in *[Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)*.
The project aimed at building a single-page application featuring an area on Google Maps.
For this project I decided to list down ice-cream shops and cocktail bars in Italy and Croatia. The website lists the locations of my interest and can be filtered out through search bar.
